# Take the coords of the domain as well as that of the boundary polygons, a default ID and list of ID's contained inside the boundary-polygons. For the exterior of the domain it will create Shapely Lines from sequential points and see if the line intersects one of the boundary-polygons. For the islands: creates a Shapely polygon for each island and sees if it is fully enclosed within any of the boundary-ID polygons. 
#Returns a tuple of 2 elements: element 1 contains a list of lines that compose the external line loop of the domain; element 2 is the ID associated with each line along with a list of tuples, element 1 of the tuple is the island and element 2 is the ID of that island.
# ([line1, line2, linex], [1, 2, x]), [(polygon1, ID1), (polygon2, ID2)...]
